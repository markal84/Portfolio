    desc: "The idea behind this app emerged from my desire to have a clear and efficient way of monitoring my fitness progress. Up until now, I've been relying on a simple document on my phone, where I would update my exercise repetitions and weights. However, this approach made it difficult to track how quickly or slowly I was progressing. So, I decided to embark on creating my own app.",

      'Throughout the day, I learned the importance of careful planning and prioritizing core functionalities. Moving forward, I am equipped with Vite and React, which will enable me to create a responsive and efficient gym progress tracking app.',

      "To kickstart the development process, I resorted to my trusty drawing board. My approach involves first planning the core functionalities and features of the app. I aim to implement them as soon as possible, focusing on minimum UI design. To ensure the reliability of my app, I employ Jest for writing tests. For this project, I opted for Vite with React as my framework. The combination of Vite's fast build process and React's versatility provides a solid foundation for developing a responsive and efficient gym progress tracking app. With the initial stages of planning, implementation, and the choice of tools in place, I'm excited to dive deeper into the development process of my gym progress tracking app. Stay tuned for more updates and insights as I continue working on this project.",
